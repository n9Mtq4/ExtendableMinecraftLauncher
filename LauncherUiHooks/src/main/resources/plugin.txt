# This listener tries to replace the SwingUserInterface
# with a proxied one, although this can be dangerous and 
# breaks some things.

# This is the unsafe game launch hook
# It allows for us to capture the event first,
# and if necessary stop mojang from receiving it
com.n9mtq4.customlauncher.uihooks.GameLaunchHookUnsafe

# This listener is the safe version.
# It works, but the unsafe version works well.
# It is NOT compatible with the unsafe version
# com.n9mtq4.customlauncher.uihooks.GameLaunchHookSafe

# This listener pushes all swing objects it can get its hands on.
# Enabled for now, but can be a lot to handle for other listeners and
# the BaseConsole pushing everything to everywhere.
